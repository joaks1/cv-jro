The central themes motivating my research group are
(1) better understanding the processes that generate and maintain the amazing
biological diversity of our planet,
and
(2) integrating computational research into biology
curricula.
Within these themes, the research interests in my lab are diverse, including
biogeography,
phylogenetics,
population and conservation genomics,
genome and molecular evolution,
and 
epidemiology.
We integrate many methods in our research, including
% collection-based
field work,
genomics,
developing statistical methods and software,
and ultimately applying these computational tools to
genomic data to test
hypotheses about processes of evolution.
The questions my lab explore are integrative, open-ended, and require critical
thinking and creativity.
% As a result,
I strive to include students and collaborators with diverse backgrounds and
perspectives to bring together unique insights.

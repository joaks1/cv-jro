\textbf{\textit{What processes control the generation and assembly of
        biodiversity?}}
This question is the primary motivation of my research program.
To elucidate answers, I use patterns of genetic variation within and among
natural populations to identify evolutionary lineages and infer their
demographic histories and relationships, testing for patterns predicted by
current ecological factors and historical events.  I use a broad suite of
methods in this endeavor, including
% collection-based fieldwork,
fieldwork,
next-generation sequencing (NGS),
developing statistical procedures for inferring evolutionary
history from NGS datasets,
implementing such methods in software packages,
and ultimately applying these novel computational tools to genomic data to test
hypotheses about diversification.
% I take an integrative approach to answering open-ended questions about
% biodiversity, which requires critical thinking and creativity.
% As a result, it is imperative that I involve students with diverse
% backgrounds and interests, who can bring unique perspectives to the
% challenges in my lab.
% Given the integrative nature of my research program, I seek to recruit students
% with diverse backgrounds and interests.
% The questions I am passionate about exploring are integrative, open-ended, and
% require critical thinking and creativity.
% As a result, it is imperative that I involve students and collaborators with
% diverse backgrounds and perspectives to bring together unique insights.
